## Project Overview

This project involves data wrangling and analysis of datasets related to depression. The goal was to clean and combine data from different sources, then perform exploratory data analysis to answer specific research questions.

## Datasets

1. **Dataset 1: Indicators of Anxiety or Depression**
   - **Source:** [CDC API](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8pt5-q6wp/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD)
   - **Format:** JSON
   - **Method:** Downloaded via API
   - **Description:** Contains data on indicators of anxiety or depression based on reported symptoms over the last 7 days. Focus was on age and gender classifications.

2. **Dataset 2: Rural Life Conditions**
   - **Source:** [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?src=0&query=depression&docid=L2cvMTF0c2M4ODJncQ%3D%3D)
   - **Format:** CSV
   - **Method:** Manually downloaded
   - **Description:** Includes data on depression and life conditions in rural zones.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Gathering**
   - Collected data from the CDC API and manually from Kaggle.

2. **Data Assessment**
   - Evaluated data quality and tidiness, identifying missing values and inconsistencies.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Cleaned the datasets by addressing issues such as missing values and format inconsistencies.
   - Processed and merged datasets to prepare for analysis.

4. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to answer research questions regarding depression:
     - **Which age group is more affected by depression?**
     - **Which gender is more affected by depression?**
   - Created visualizations to present findings.

5. **Results**
   - **Age:** The rate of depression was consistent across age intervals.
   - **Gender:** Depression rates were equal among genders.



## Reflection

For further improvement, additional datasets and research questions could be explored to gain more comprehensive insights. Future work could investigate the impact of other factors such as religion or marital status on depression.
